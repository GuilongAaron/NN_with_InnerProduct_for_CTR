# Neural Network with InnerProduct Deployment for CTR

## background 

CTR prediction is a very common task for ad evaluation and analysis.
This program provides a simple neural network with inner product layer proposed by Y. Qu in the paper [Product-based Neural Networks for User Response Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.00144)

## input data

Train and target data are provided in the data folder.
They are preprocessed data in percentage of display percentage and CTR for a certain category.
